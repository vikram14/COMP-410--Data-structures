# Dijkstra's shortest path
For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path, if it exists, between that node and every other node in the graph

![Dijkstra's Algorithm](./images/Dijkstras)

The algorithm makes use of a priority queue implemented using a minimum binary heap. The algorithm runs in O(|V|+|E|) time where |V| is the number of vertices(nodes) and |E| is the number of edges (path from one node to another)
